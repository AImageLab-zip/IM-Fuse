"""Budget-conditioned architecture search over the nnU-Net macro-architecture.

The goal is to learn ``budget -> architecture`` as a single function, rather than
searching for one architecture per operating point.  Architectures are nested by
construction: ``b1 < b2`` implies ``A(b1)`` is a subnetwork of ``A(b2)``.

Modules:

``budget``
    Log-space budget <-> normalized coordinate conversions.
``param_count``
    Exact (integer) and differentiable (soft) parameter accounting.
``arch_config``
    ``ArchitectureConfig`` + ``build_network`` -- an explicit description of a
    point in the search space.
``gates``
    Monotone, prefix-structured width gates conditioned on the budget.
``calibration``
    Places gate thresholds so requested budget matches realized parameters.
``extract``
    Materializes a standalone ``SimpleUnet`` with weights inherited from the
    supernet.
